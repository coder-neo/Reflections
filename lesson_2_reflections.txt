What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

On executing git init .git directory is created which maintains respository structure.
All the information about the commits and repository revision history is stored in this
directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains all the files in that directory while statging area
contains the files which we want to commit and add into repository. Suppose I have
made lots of changes in a project which spans over various files, but I want to see
reflections of a particular changes,instead of all changes that I have made in my
current working directory. Here staging area helps to add the particular files and 
commit those.
