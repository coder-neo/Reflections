What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

On executing git init .git directory is created which maintains respository structure.
All the information about the commits and repository revision history is stored in this
directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains all the files in that directory while statging area
contains the files which we want to commit and add into repository. Suppose I have
made lots of changes in a project which spans over various files, but I want to see
reflections of a particular changes,instead of all changes that I have made in my
current working directory. Here staging area helps to add the particular files and 
commit those.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add the files relevant to a particular logical change and commit it first and then
proceed to next change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

Suppose I have two features in mind for the project, but I am not sure which one will
look better, in this case I can create two separate branches for both the features and 
when I am done selecting one of the two I can merge them with master branch.
