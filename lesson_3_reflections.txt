When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories help to keep the project file on the cloud, so I can access it from any computer anywhere.
Moreover if there are more contributors to the project it make sense to have a common remote repository and 
makes changes on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

There might be changes in local repo, if git automatically pulls remote repository, then we can lose local changes.
So I think it is a good idea to do pull request manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks : Cloning repository on github account. Use - For cloning to github acccount directly
Clones : Cloning repository into local directory from a remote or local repository. 
Use : To save repo on local machine, for working on project.
Branches : Labels for commits. Use : For project with multiple features or an experimental feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To find out diff between remote copy and local copy, keep track of extra commits made 
compared to remote copy
