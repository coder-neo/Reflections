When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories help to keep the project file on the cloud, so I can access it from any computer anywhere.
Moreover if there are more contributors to the project it make sense to have a common remote repository and 
makes changes on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

There might be changes in local repo, if git automatically pulls remote repository, then we can lose local changes.
So I think it is a good idea to do pull request manually.
